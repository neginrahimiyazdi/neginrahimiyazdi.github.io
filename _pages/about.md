I am currently in my final year as an undergraduate student, pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics at [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en). My research interests encompass optimization, algorithms, graph theory, and machine learning.

In my leisure time, I have a passion for memorizing poems.

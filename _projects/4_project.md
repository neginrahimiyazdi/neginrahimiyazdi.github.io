This project focuses on data analysis and classification using the powerful data mining tool, RapidMiner. It can be divided into two main sections.

First Section: Data Preprocessing
In the initial section of the project, the focus is on data preprocessing. The key activities include:

-Handling missing data.

-Utilizing RapidMiner for data preprocessing and feature selection.

-Preparing the dataset for further analysis.

Second Section: Classification with Decision Trees
The second section of the project involves classification tasks using decision trees within RapidMiner. Here are the main components:

-Classification of heart disease using a multi-class approach.

-Data collection and linking data files to heart-related data.

-Implementing k-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance.

-Dividing the dataset into 20-80 ratios for training and testing.

-Analyzing the results and using them for model validation and improvement.

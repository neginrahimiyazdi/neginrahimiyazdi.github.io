This project focuses on comparing the performance of three popular machine learning models: Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for the task of income prediction. The primary goal is to construct predictive models based on a dataset of individuals' characteristics and income levels.

**Key Project Steps**:

**Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - The dataset contains information about 32,561 individuals, with features related to income.
   - Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, categorical encoding, and data standardization or normalization.
   - Sklearn's model library is utilized for pedestrian modeling.

**Model Comparison and Analysis**:
   - The project involves training three machine learning models: Decision Trees, SVM, and KNN.
   - Visual graphs and analysis are used to compare the performance of these models.
   - Handling null values and encoding categorical data is a crucial aspect of data preparation.

**Performance Evaluation**:
   - Performance evaluation is carried out using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - The confusion matrix is used to assess model performance.
   - Sklearn's libraries are leveraged for calculating these metrics.

**Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Hyperparameter tuning is performed using sklearn's capabilities to optimize each model's performance.
   - Results from the tuning process are reported and analyzed.

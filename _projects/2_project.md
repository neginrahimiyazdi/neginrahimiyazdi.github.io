The Custom Grep Command Implementation project is designed to provide users with a versatile and efficient search tool inspired by the widely used grep command in the Linux operating system. This custom grep command offers the following essential features:

Search Flexibility:
   - Users can specify whether they want to search within the content of files.
   - Users can search for file and folder names.
   - Users have the option to perform a combination of both content and name-based searches.

Line Number Display:
   - The tool enhances user experience by displaying line numbers where the search pattern is found within files.
   - This feature enables users to quickly pinpoint relevant information within the searched content.

Search Depth Control:
   - Users are granted the flexibility to define the search depth within directories.
   - This allows for precise control over the search scope, ensuring that the tool meets users' specific requirements.

Multithreaded Searching:
   - To boost search speed and overall efficiency, the custom grep command harnesses the power of multithreading.
   - At least two threads are utilized to expedite the search process, significantly reducing search times.

Pattern Exclusion:
   - Similar to the functionality of the original grep command, users can choose to display files or lines that do not contain the specified search pattern.
   - This feature aids users in filtering out irrelevant information from search results.
